;In the languagedata field, enter the language name in that language. Example: For English, enter ÅgEnglishÅh.
;This will appear in the list of language settings within the Window/Screen Settings of the qwerty3x configuration.

languagesetting===en_US
;Enter the identifier for this language file in the languagesetting field.
;There are no naming rules for identifiers. However, identifiers must not conflict.
;This file uses country code & language code to create the identifier,
;but you are not required to follow this naming convention.
;This identifier is not displayed within qwerty3x,
;but it is included in the configuration file and saved when qwerty3x uses this file.
;The most important point is that Ågthe identifier and the filename (excluding the extension) must be identicalÅh.
;Example: ÅgIf the identifier is Åeen_USÅf, the filename must be Åeen_US.q3lfÅfÅh.

Lines starting with Åg;Åh are recognized as comments,
so they can be used as memo areas.

Portions enclosed in Åg%Åh like Åg%qwertyver%Åh are replaced with variables within qwerty3x.
Therefore, do not modify the string enclosed within Åg%Åh.

The structure is Ågidentifier number===stringÅh.
Do not change the identifier number.
